2️⃣ Lab Overview / Consulting Context

Multi-host networking is the backbone of enterprise infrastructure. Proper static IP planning, firewall hardening, and routing are essential for hybrid cloud readiness, high availability, and secure operations. This lab ensures your VMs can communicate predictably, mimic enterprise VLAN/subnet setups, and enforce security policies at the OS level.

3️⃣ Prerequisites

Completed Day 1 & Day 2 labs

Root/sudo access to all VMs

Terminal / SSH client

2–3 VMs (or nodes) with static IPs assigned

4️⃣ Step-by-Step Lab Execution (With Objectives)
Step 1 — Assign Static IPs to Multiple Hosts

Objective: Ensure predictable, enterprise-ready networking for multi-node lab.

# Example for Ubuntu netplan (/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml)
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.56.10/24   # Node1
        - 192.168.56.11/24   # Node2
        - 192.168.56.12/24   # Node3
      gateway4: 192.168.56.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]

Apply changes:

sudo netplan apply
ip addr show
Step 2 — Test Multi-Host Connectivity

Objective: Verify all nodes can ping each other and the gateway.

ping -c 3 192.168.56.11  # From Node1 to Node2
ping -c 3 192.168.56.12  # From Node1 to Node3
Step 3 — Configure Firewall Rules (UFW)

Objective: Restrict traffic to only necessary ports and secure multi-node communication.

# Default deny incoming, allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH between nodes
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any port 22

# Optional: Allow ICMP (ping)
sudo ufw allow proto icmp

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
Step 4 — Setup Hostname & /etc/hosts Across Nodes

Objective: Ensure each VM can resolve each other without DNS (enterprise best practice).

# On Node1
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname node1
echo "192.168.56.10 node1" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.56.11 node2" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "192.168.56.12 node3" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
Step 5 — Verify SSH Access Between Nodes

Objective: Confirm secure remote access between all hosts.

ssh devops1@192.168.56.11
ssh devops1@192.168.56.12
Step 6 — Document Network & Firewall Config

Objective: Maintain enterprise-grade documentation for audits and troubleshooting.

Network_Config.md → IPs, hostnames, routing, firewall rules

5️⃣ Automation Scripts / Config Files

MultiHost_NetworkSetup.sh

#!/bin/bash
# Apply netplan configuration
sudo netplan apply

# Firewall setup
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any port 22
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose

Network_Config.md → detailed documentation

6️⃣ Failure Injection & Observability

Scenario 1: IP conflict → simulate and resolve
Scenario 2: Node cannot ping another → simulate routing issue and fix
Scenario 3: SSH blocked by firewall → troubleshoot rules

Artifacts:

FailureInjection_Day3.txt → steps & observations

FailureInjection_Day3.png → screenshots/logs

7️⃣ Knowledge Graph / Lab Dependencies
Day1 → VM & Static IP (single host)

Day2 → Users & Groups
       ↓
Day3 → Multi-Host Networking & Firewall
       ↓
Day4 → Directory/Workspace Sharing, Permissions
